# References
For this project, we were mainly inspired by Museum Bagong of Anatomy which is located in Jatim Park. We wanted to bring that experience to the digital world so that a lot more people can access the knowledge about the human body in a fun and interesting way.

# Levels
- For the first level, there is a baby, posing as the museums entrance, which we can interact with space to enter the museum. Around the baby there is also an environment which can be explored if the player wants.
- The player will be taken to the level 1 intro screen, which is a mouth, since level 1 is about the mouth area of the digestive system.
- The player would be taken inside the mouth, introduced with a quiz, that if the player can answer correctly, would grant cosmetic badges.
- There are also visual guides and models on this level, showcasing the muscular and various organs and parts around the mouth such as the salivary glands, the gums, the teeth and tongue, and more.

# Mechanics
- Basics such as the movement of the player to navigate around the scene and how the player looks around is implemented to immerse the player experience.
- Interactables like the entrance to the museum and the quizzes are planned to make the experience as interactive as possible.

# Apology
For now, what we are able to implement is still shallow, and we are sorry for that, hopefully we will be able to make it up for the revision.
